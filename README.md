# ResearchScripts
A collection of simple scripts I've put together for my physics postdoc research.

## Files
* fhiatoms.py - lists the number and type of atoms in an FHI-aims geometry file.
* fhizsort.py - sorts an FHI-aims geometry file by z-coordinate. Useful for surface calculations.
* fhigeometry.py - extracts the last geometry step from FHI-aims output file. It preserves any constraints used in the input geometry.
